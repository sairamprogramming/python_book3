Q:1. What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?

Sol: The two boolean values signify true and false states. They are represented in python as True and False.

Q:2. What are the three Boolean operators?

Sol: The three boolean operators are and, or and not.

Q:3. Write out the truth tables of each Boolean operator (that is, every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what they evaluate to).

Sol: Truth Table for 'and':
    
     True and True   --> True
     True and False  --> False
     False and True  --> False
     False and False --> False
     
     Truth Table for 'or':

     True or True   --> True
     True or False  --> True
     False or True  --> True
     False or False --> False

     Truth Table for 'not'

     not True  --> False
     not False --> True

Q:4. What do the following expressions evaluate to?

a) (5 > 4) and (3 == 5) --> False

b) not (5 > 4) --> False

c) (5 > 4) or (3 == 5) --> True

d) not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)) --> False

d) (True and True) and (True == False) --> False

e) (not False) or (not True) --> True

Q:5. What are the six comparison operators?

Sol: The six comparison operators are:

        == --> equals to
        != --> not equals to
        >  --> greater than
        <  --> less than
        >= --> greater than equal to
        <= --> less than equal to
        
Q:6. What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment operator?

Sol: The equal to operator checks for equality between the two of its operands. The assignment 
     statement takes the value on the LHS and assigns it to the variable on the RHS.

Q:7. Explain what a condition is and where you would use one.

Sol: A condition is any boolean expression. It is used as a check in flow control statements.

Q:8. Identify the three blocks in this code:

# Block 1
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
    # Block 2
    print('eggs')
    if spam > 5:
        # Block 3
        print('bacon')
    # Block 2
    else:
        # Block 3
        print('ham')
    # Block 2
    print('spam')
# Block 1
print('spam')

Q:9. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

Sol: if spam == 1:
        print('Hello')
     elif spam == 2:
        print('Howdy')
     else:
        print('Greetings')

Q:10. What can you press if your program is stuck in an infinite loop?

Sol: You can press ctrl + c for keyboard interrupt of the program running the infinite loop.

Q:11. What is the difference between break and continue?

Sol: The break statement is used to immediately get out of the loop.
     
     The continue statement skips all other statements in the loop and
     moves onto the next iteration of the loop.

Q:12. What is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1) in a for loop?

Sol: There is no difference between the three statements. All three perform the same operation.

Q:13. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

Sol:    # Using for Loop.
        for number in range(1,11):
            print(number)
        
        # Using while Loop.
        number = 0
        while number <= 10:
            print(number)
            number += 1
        
Q:14. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?

Sol: spam.bacon(), this is the way to call a function from a imported module.
